Sample RPG Maker MV project with taaspider's free plugins.

Currently, it contains a demo for the following plugin:

### **TAA_BookMenu**:
  
    _When we create a game, we usually create a whole new world rich in lore and details, and want to make it all available to the players, so that they can understand every single detail we develop. However, just dumping it all in lengthy dialogues usually bore and scare most of the players, who will simply give up on your world._

    _A common alternative used by many AAA games is to minimize dialogue and exposition, and provide additional details through in-game books._
    
    _This plugin aims to provide just that for your game: a book menu where the player can read up additional lore when he feels up to it. You can place books throughout your game, providing a bit more of context for hungry players as they progress, and keeping exposition to a minimum._
